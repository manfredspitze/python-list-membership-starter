### Notes

- Essentially, an **operator** is a symbol you can use to modify/change a variable or its value in some way
- Python (and other programming languages) offer programmers different families of operators, including:
  - arithmetic operators (for doing math)
  - assignment operators
  - comparison operators
  - logical operators
  - membership operators
- See the list of operators above in **Related Resources**
- When using multiple operators together, remember to keep the *order of operations* (PEMDAS) your math teacher told you about in mind

```
print(100 + 5 * 3)

# Multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, and needs to be evaluated first
# The calculation above works out to be: 100 + 15 = 115
```
