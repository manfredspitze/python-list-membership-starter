# Using List Methods to Manage a Python List

## Objectives

Students will learn to:

- create and add items to a Python list
- add an item to a list using the `append()` method
- use the `in` operator to check if an item is contained in a list
- use the `index()` method to find the index number of a specific list item

## General Requirements

- Add a comment block to the top of your script
```python
# Abe Lincoln
# 21 APR 20XX
# Intro to Python Variables
```
- Use correct spelling and grammar
- Sprinkle short, specific comments throughout your code
- Use short, descriptive names for your files
- Name your files in lowercase

## Getting Started

In your script:

 - Define a list named `shopping_list` that contains at least five grocery items
 - Print the original list
 - Use the `append()` method to add one or more items to your grocery list
 - Use the `remove()` method to delete at least one item from your grocery list
 - Use an `if-else` statement and the Python `in` operator to check if an item is contained in your grocery list
    - if the item is in the list, display a message informing the user the item is still in the list
    - if the item is **NOT** in the list, let the user know the item was not found in the list
- Use the `index()` method to get the index number of a specific item in your grocery list
- Display a short message that displays the index number of the requested item
    - Example: *The index number for milk is 4.*
    - Example: *The index number for apples is 1.*
