## Submitting Your Work

>

## Your Script

- Write a Python script that:
  - contains either a list of 4 - 5 items OR a string assigned to a variable
  - Use the `not` and `in` operators together to help Python determine if a specific item OR character is present in the list or the string
  - If the specific item or character is contained in the list (or the string), tell Python to print the value of 'True'
  - Tell Python to print the value 'False' if the specific item or character IS NOT contained in the list (or in the string)

**Remember to add a comment block to the top of your script.**
